A repo that ever has more than one non-patch release — which this one already does — ends up with more than one H1 and, on each of those releases, an H1-straight-to-H3 skip. Fixed here at the template level rather than by disabling the markdown linter's heading rules for CHANGELOG.md: the version header is always H2, so it is always a valid H2-then-H3 sequence and the file's only real H1 stays this repository's own "# Changelog" title, for every release from now on, not just this one.
